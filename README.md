# Week1_2Repository
 
For the JPA-Relations assignment for Tuesday I managed to get to the second project and assignment 3. I started experiencing issues 
when attempting OneToMany relations. We were told in class to focus on the later assignments (Wednesday/Thursday) so we did not get 
behind during class, and seeing as I am very short on time I don't expect to finish the Tuesday assignment.
Regardless it can be found in the folders:
- 02-25_JPAEntityMappings
- 02-25_JPARelations

Wednesday/Thursday also started giving issues. I have tested with Postman that my endpoints are working, but there's an annoying 
error somewhere in the Facade (I presume) that prevents me from saving to the DB. I am still stuck on this error and haven't done 
the Friday assignment due to this :(

I would guess that I am approximately haflway done this week. I have the basics of the Thursday part down, but didn't get to implement 
the Address entity class and the REST tests (though I did test with Postman).

I hope I can get a couple of study points for what I've done despite this.
